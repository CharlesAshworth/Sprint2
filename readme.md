(Sprint 2)
This project was created by Charles Ashworth for COMP 490
This project pulls the information from the Wufoo survey using an API
There is an API key which will not be shared directly to Github due to security purposes
   - Creates a Database 'wufoo_data.db'
   - Creates table(s) corresponding to Wufoo Survey sent in sprint 1
   - Pulls information
   - Imports the pulled information to wufoo_data.db
   - Closes the database


Here is what is not working properly
- I cannot get a tester to work properly
- I cannot get the linter setup correctly


Here is the link to the Survey --> https://charlieashworth23.wufoo.com/forms/zv9axo1n8asf9/
